# js-basics

JavaScript is a very popular programming language for frontend development. This repository contains some sample code I wrote when I was learning JavaScript preparing my for intership applications. Some of them are trivial, and some of them are a bit complicated - but these are all essential as they are part of the learning process of a new programming language for me.

Some resources are still being organized and I will post them when they are ready.
